ocaml program:
The program is an implementation of the Caesar Cipher in OCaml, demonstrating basic encryption and decryption functionalities. The shift_char function handles the shifting of characters, and caesar_cipher applies this to strings. The program encrypts and decrypts a sample message using a specified shift amount. Test cases include various scenarios: empty string, zero shift, large positive and negative shifts, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, and the correct handling of non-alphabetic characters. The implementation has been refined to handle large positive shifts more accurately, ensuring robust encryption and decryption testing

to run ocml program with
```ocaml ocaml_program.ml```

python program:
accepts a list of integers
-emits an error message if the list is not a multiple of 10 in length
-returns or prints a list of integers based on the input list, but with items at positions which are a multiple of 2 or 3 removed
and pass the 10 cases 

to run python program with
```pytest python_program.py```
